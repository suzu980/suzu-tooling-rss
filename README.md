# RSS Flask Python Backend

This is a Personal Flask project for myself to call RSS feeds. 

Mostly just for me to learn a bit of python backend programming. 

Why RSS feeds? 

With social media dictating your experiences on what you see, you may not see what you want to really see, or irrelevant to your interests.
